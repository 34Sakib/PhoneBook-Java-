# PhoneBook-Java-

# 📞 PhoneBook Java Project

This is a simple **PhoneBook** application developed in Java as part of our **OOP1 project**. The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts including **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **abstraction**, **polymorphism**, and the use of **interfaces**.


## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interface usage
- Array-based data handling

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project consists of 4 main classes and 1 interface:

- `Device` - Abstract base class representing a generic device.
- `MobilePhone` - Inherits from `Device`, contains core logic for managing contacts.
- `Contact` - Encapsulates contact information (name, phone number, etc.).
- `Menu` - Handles interaction logic.
- `Operations` (Interface) - Defines the core operations of the phonebook (e.g., add, update, delete, search).

## 🚀 Features

- Add a new contact
- Display all existing contacts
- Update an existing contact
- Remove a contact
- Check if a contact exists
- Check balance (simulated feature)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
